Welcome to Fractal Color Patterns - Mathematical Art Visualization

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
Exploring the infinite beauty of complex mathematics

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
Mandelbrot set: z_{n+1} = z_n² + c, where z₀ = 0

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
Watch as complex numbers escape to infinity

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Julia set visualization with c = -0.7269 + 0.1889i

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Each pixel represents thousands of mathematical iterations

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
Color mapping based on convergence speed

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
Zooming deeper into fractal self-similarity

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Newton's method reveals polynomial root patterns

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Mathematical chaos creates organic beauty

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
Current zoom level: 2.547 × 10¹² magnification

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
Escape radius |z| > 2 determines boundary conditions

01:34.000 --> 01:42.000
RGB interpolation creates smooth color transitions

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
Fractal dimension between 1 and 2

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
Self-similar patterns repeat at every scale

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
Mathematics meets art in perfect harmony

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Thank you for exploring the infinite with us
